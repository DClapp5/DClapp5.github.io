    <h1>Welcome to my flow website</h1>
    <p>I will share with you a bit about my flow</p>
    <h2>These are some ways that I can get in my flow:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Enjoying a topic</li>
        <li>Sense of urgency</li>
    </ol>
    <p>One website that I enjoy using is <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com">PC Part Picker</a>. It is a website used to research PC parts and put together lists for them. I am a big fan of computers so this website is great for me. </p>
